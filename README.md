# Eat Da Burger!

A Burger Eatin' Application With Node.js/Express/MySQL/Handlebars/Bootstrap

## Description
This application demonstrates a simple full stack application with a front end implemented with HTML/CSS and elements from the Bootstrap framework and the backend implemented with Node.js and Express. HTML templating is done with the help of Handlebars.

The user may enter any burger name to add it to the list. This also adds the new burger entry into the MySQL database. The initial burger entry is added as "haven't tried yet" on the menu and placed on the left side of the screen. When the user has tried the burger they can choose if they liked it or not, which moves it into the correct column and updates its status accordingly in the database.  The user may, also, delete the burger which will remove it from the database.
